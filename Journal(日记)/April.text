Finally, we entered April.
Special thanks to Yu Xiao, a senior of our, who instructed us about a lot today,
Today, we rejected the structure adopted before on Wallaby ( ball collecting), instead, we used a mechanical hand to catch the ball. Furthermore, we decided to put the balls on the 3rd argi area if possible.
As for the create, HKQ built a strcture with a box that uses paper and axles, and a motor with 3 lego liftarm that can roll and make the balls out of the box.
The strategy is changed again and Tu suggested us to make a final one for the qualifier ASAP. 
See pictures uploaded today.
