Building Review
=====================================================================

Hi, I am axmmsaka, the main builder of the wallaby. After partly finished the building, we are trying to do some reviews.

1.The selection of lego pin, screws and nuts or nylock.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

*Logo pin should only be used to connect between lego parts and electrical parts, unless it's only used for extending lego parts from metal parts.

*Screws and nuts/nylock can be used to connect all parts, including lego parts, metal parts etc.

*Use propriate screws. Overlength screws may be a messy thing. When using nuts, screws can be little longer.

*If making connectors very tight is needed, use nylock. When using nylock, screws must be JUST fit, somethin' like this:

Screw
     T  
-O-O-v-O-(Lego)  
     v  
-O-O-v-O-  
     â– (Nylock)
